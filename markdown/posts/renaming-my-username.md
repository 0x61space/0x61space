I've gotten really anxious about my online presence lately, especially with cancel culture being what it is. I'm worried that one small mistake could lead to me being publicly persecuted. And then there's all this AI shenanigans that scrapes everyone's data.

Since my name is pretty unusual, anyone who hears it can just Google it and see what apps I'm on and what I've been up to.

So now I'm working on removing my digital traces. At least with my full name. I still go by my first name on social media so my acquaintances or close friends can still recognize me.
