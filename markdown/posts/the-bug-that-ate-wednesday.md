I came in with a scalpel —
a small cut, a clean fix,
the kind of work that hums quietly
and asks nothing of you.

Then came the voice from above:
*"While you're in there, there's something else."*

There always is.

So I pulled a thread,
and called the one who draws the world into shapes,
and she redrew it — faithfully,
the way it used to be,
the way we all agreed it should be.

And the voice returned,
wearing the face of a question:
*"Why does it look like this?
Why did we ever do it this way?"*

As if I had invented history.
As if the past were my handwriting.

*Why are we even here?
Why did no one see this sooner?*

I held the question like a stone —
heavy, shapeless, not mine to answer,
yet somehow, entirely mine to carry.

You touch one thing,
and the ground shifts,
and suddenly everyone is asking
who built this city
and why on a fault line.

I closed my workshop at dusk.
The wound was dressed.
The shape was changed.
The questions remained,
as questions do —
unanswered,
unremarkable,
already forgotten by morning.

*Tomorrow, another thread.*
